# Text Summarization : Django web application 
The project is used to study the correlation between text summerization models ROUGE scores and User preferences.
We picked 3 models from the pegasus family(Pegasus Adam,Pegasus Xsum, Pegasus Cnn) for summarizing news articles from the CNN/Daily mail dataset.To study more about the correlation between the preference score and ROUGE scores , we displayed 15 news articles along with their golden summary and the models predicted summary to get the user preference scores from the web application.
